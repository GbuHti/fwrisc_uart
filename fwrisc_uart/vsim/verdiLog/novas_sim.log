*Verdi3* WARNING: fsdbDumpfile - One FSDB file has already opened for dumping.
*Verdi3* : Begin traversing the scope (fwrisc_uart_tb), layer (0).
*Verdi3* : End of traversing.
*Verdi3* WARNING: 

  $fsdbDumpMem is obsolete. Use $fsdbDumpMDA instead.
  This may result in a larger FSDB file size as $fsdbDumpMDA will
  dump the memory contents with every change instead of only when
  the command is called.
