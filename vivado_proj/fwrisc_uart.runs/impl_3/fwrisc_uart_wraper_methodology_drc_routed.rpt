2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance u_fwrisc_fpga_top/u_core/u_regfile/regs_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance u_fwrisc_fpga_top/u_core/u_regfile/regs_reg_2, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#1 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM u_fwrisc_fpga_top/ram_0_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#2 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM u_fwrisc_fpga_top/ram_1_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#3 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM u_fwrisc_fpga_top/ram_2_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#4 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM u_fwrisc_fpga_top/ram_3_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>
